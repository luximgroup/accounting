This module adds two new date fields on invoice.

This module makes the old 'invoice_date' field on invoice act as service date,
which is considered as debt start relation date in some accounting standards
(for VAT purposes), while new 'invoice_date_creation' field serves as date of
invoice.

New field 'invoice_date_received' is also added on vendor bills.
